# tpnoted (Ruby)

tpnoted is a simple service for the storage and retrieval of encrypted notes.
Notes are encrypted and decrypted transparently using OpenSSL, with filesystem
storage containing only the ciphertext.

This repository has *notebook* status, meaning that it is released in the hope
it will be useful, but it is not under active development and there are no
releases planned.
